This paper contains information and proof of what spatial- and temporal-resolutions are necessary to produce accurate results. [[241113_PyPSA3_MartaVictoria_ModernPyPSAapplications.pdf]]

The simplex algorithm cheks all the vertexes of the multidimenional solution space as we know that the global minimum will be situated on a vertex. In this way it iterates like the gradient method over all the vertexes.
