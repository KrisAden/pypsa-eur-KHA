In order to begin exploring the solution space it must first be bounded by the governing equations contained within a network model. For the purpose of this project the open source PyPSA-Eur framework was used as a basis for the networks. According to the framework developers "**PyPSA-Eur**Â is an open model dataset of the European power system at the transmission network level that covers the full ENTSO-E area." \cite{horschPyPSAEurOpenOptimisation2018}

This repository contains pre-built network models produced by the PyPSA-eur default configuration and comes in a varying amount of nodes clustered by the k-means method \cite{BuildingElectricityNetworksa}

The provided levels are:
- 1024
- 512
- 256
- 128
- 37

Here the 37 node network, which will be used due to its lower computational resources required, represent the EU-27 (excluding the island states of Malta and Cyprus) as well as Albania, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, and The United Kingdom.

Additionally the following countries all have 2 nodes: Denmark, Spain, United Kingdom, and Italy. The layout of the nodes can be seen in the figure below:

The clustering of nodes of course raises the question of the effects which the procedure will have upon the outcomes of the optimization problem. According to \cite{schaferScalingTransmissionCapacities2017} 
"By changing the network topology as well as the spatio-temporal pattern of nodal power injections, this coarse-graining procedure has in particular an impact on the power flows and the resulting transmission infrastructure needs proposed by the model."

The paper, which analyses the impacts of this "coarse graining" goes on to find that although the clustering has a noticeable impact on the power flow distribution pattern, the required transmission capacity and cost of tranmission infrastructure scales "weakly" with the spatial resolution of the network. One reason for this is explored in \cite{schyskaSensitivityPowerSystem2021a} where it is explained that the large correlation length of wind and solar patterns means that the clustering of networks does not necessarily lead to less information.
As a result of these findings it is assumed that the 37 node spatial resolution of the  network will be sufficient for the purpose of this paper.

As for the temporal resolution of the load, patterns and the capacity factors of the renewable energy technologies. The precompiled networks have data on an hourly basis. The same paper concludes that temporal resolution  "...leads to significant differences in the optimal capacity deployment..."

This is caused by the fact that decreasing temporal resolution acts as a filter that smoothes out variability and thus leads especially to changes in necessary storage capacity.  The paper does go on to conclude that a 1-hor temporal resolution is sufficient to capture most system fluctuations.

As for the energy producing technologies each node has a mix of energy generating technologies or "Busses". Included in this model are fifteen different energy producing technologies. These are:

The dispatchable energy-generating technologies included in the model are open cycle gas turbines (OCGT), combined cycle and gas turbines (CCGT), biomass combustion, coal combustion, oil combustion, lignite combustion, and nuclear power production. In addition pumped hydro storage is also considered dispatchable although with the constraint that the energy must have been stored previously.

Non-dispatchable busses include run-of-river, onshore wind, offshore wind (both AC and DC), solar photovoltaic PV, geothermal and hydro energy.

The nodes are connected by 51 AC lines divided into 35 different types of connection and 43 HVDC links. Transformation is handled by 43 different types of transformers at the nodes. In total The network contains 283 generator units and 49 storage units. 

The modelled capacities of the energy generation, both renewable and non-renewable, as well as existing transmission capacity and electricity load time series are all provided through PyPSA-EUR.

For renewable energy technologies the existing capacity PyPSA-PyPSA calculates installable capacity (for renewable energy expansion) and the capacity factor time series based on land availability as defined by GIS datasets like CORINE, LUISA, Natura 2000, GEBCO and shipping lanes \cite{BuildingElectricityNetworksb}. This is then converted to energy systems data using the atlite library \cite{hofmannAtliteLightweightPython2021}. This conversion requires hourly weather data across europe which is provided by the SARAH-3 dataset for solar radiation data
