I think automatically importing code from my repository by converting to markdown and then syncing is too much trouble for the gain. This here will be used in the future for copying in usefull code bits and commands from VS code but the main bulk of the work will take place over there. However both the code from the repository and this obsidian vault should both be backed up in the same GitHub repository
