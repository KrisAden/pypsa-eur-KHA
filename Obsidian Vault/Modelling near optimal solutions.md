## Optimal Portfolio theory

The two papers by Pedersen et al: 
- [[Pedersen m.fl. - 2021 - Modeling all alternative solutions for highly renewable energy systems.pdf]]
- [[Pedersen m.fl. - 2023 - Using Modeling All Alternatives to explore 55% decarbonization scenarios of the European electricity.pdf]]

Contain A lot of theory on modelling alternatives but do not include any theory on Optimal portfolio theory. This is covered in another paper:  [[Eriksen m.fl. - 2017 - Optimal heterogeneity in a simplified highly renewable European electricity system.pdf]]

However, the 2021 Paper by Pedersen defines the Gini coefficient as a measure of equality in self sufficiency
$$

G=\frac{A}{(A+B)}
