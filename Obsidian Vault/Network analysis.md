The purpose of the energy system network is to act as the “base layer” on which the optimization routines will act. The structure of the network is of critical importance as the limitations and bounds of technologies, availability of resources, transmission capacities, environmental impacts and so forth all have to be predefined before the actual energy system model can be properly defined and constrained.

Following is an analysis of the network used by Tim Tørnæs in [[Pedersen m.fl. - 2023 - Using Modeling All Alternatives to explore 55% decarbonization scenarios of the European electricity.pdf]]
\cite{pedersenUsingModelingAll2023}
to act as inspiration and a source of knowledge in regards to good practices when designing the network.
