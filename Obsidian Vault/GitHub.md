Okay so i have a fork of the PyPSA-Eur repository located at C:\Users\krisa\Documents\GitHub\pypsa-eur\pypsa-eur-KHA.

This is entirely mine and currently only has a main branch which i am committing to. After having made a change i simply add a note to the commit in the bottom left and then commit. Afterwards if i am ready to upload i simply push to my main branch and the changes are uploaded.

the backup of the vault can be checked by going into the commands and finding the "open source" option for the git extension.
