In order to begin exploring the solution space it must first be bounded by the governing equations contained within a network model. For the purpose of this project the open source PyPSA-Eur framework was used as a basis for the networks. According to the framework developers "**PyPSA-Eur**Â is an open model dataset of the European power system at the transmission network level that covers the full ENTSO-E area." \cite{horschPyPSAEurOpenOptimisation2018}

this repository contains pre-built network models produced by the PyPSA-eur default configuration and comes in a varying amount of nodes clustered by the k-means method \cite{BuildingElectricityNetworksa}
