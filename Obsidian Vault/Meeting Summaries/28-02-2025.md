The meeting is held online via zoom.

Initially the problems with Gurobi licences is discussed. Since the workflow is running on an HPC a floating license is needed for the optimization to run on multiple machines at a time. This is sometimes an issue as floating Gurobi academic licences are only active for 90 days at a time. I state that my licence has run out and i have trouble with installing a new licence on the cluster. Alexander tells me that he cannot remember how that is done and that his licence has probably run out over his paternal leave as well so we should both look into it over the weekend and he will contact me if he finds a solution.

Next i introduce [[Network analysis outline]]
