The meeting is held online via zoom.

Initially the problems with Gurobi licences is discussed. Since the workflow is running on an HPC a floating license is needed for the optimization to run on multiple machines at a time. This is sometimes an issue as floating Gurobi academic licences are only active for 90 days at a time. I state that my licence has run out and i have trouble with installing a new licence on the cluster. Alexander tells me that he cannot remember how that is done and that his licence has probably run out over his paternal leave as well so we should both look into it over the weekend and he will contact me if he finds a solution.

Next i introduce [[Network analysis outline]] and briefly mention that i have analysed the precompiled network from   \cite{horschPyPSAEurOpenOptimisation2020}
and that it seems to be highly suited for my needs.

Then the gini coefficient is discussed as a slack on the objective function along with the price increase in order to look at the near optimum solution space. The gini coefficient constraint must be a linear constraint in order for Gurobi to solve the problem or at the very least quadratic. since the Gini
